    "sessionAbstract": "Every business today has a digital footprint, whether they like it or not: it’s an expected channel of delivery and communication. But at AAA Carolinas, we weren’t driving engagement with our website. Our pain points ranged across security, UX, technology and even awareness. Our authentication mechanisms were outdated and a lack of self-serve maintenance was costing us time and money. To top it off, we knew nothing more about our members. It was very evident we needed to make a change.\n\nOur Salesforce implementation was already underway. Our Travel business had begun using SFDC as a front-line, business tracking and development tool. We had committed to expanding to an enterprise-wide “360 View of the Customer” and were working diligently to forge a plan to bring it all together. Naturally, the SFDC Community cloud made sense as a capstone initiative. Its open architecture and declarative toolset would be a significant technology upgrade while allowing us to provide targeted, intuitive engagement.\n\nIt would be a monumental task. Our success hinged on the joint efforts of multiple teams and disciplines, all of whom turned out to be valuable assets. Our Salesforce professional services teammate (PA, Mark Braga) assisted in crafting a proof of concept and worked with IT on resource alignment. Our sales, support and marketing teams challenged the “we’ve never done it that way” approach as we worked to resolve data and process issues. Most significantly, our executive team embraced the project as a critical deliverable in our digital strategy.\n\nAt current state, we’re targeting an early August roll-out for the initial launch of our community and will adopt an agile strategy for future releases, with an eye on delivering several new features before Dreamforce 2017. That said, the impact is found in the big picture. The vision of Salesforce Clouds providing a unified approach AND an organization embracing a new technology stack to solve longstanding problems is a unique story that we hope to share.\n\nAs support to the commentary above, here’s an outline supporting the framework of our presentation. We look forward to your questions and feedback.",

In our new economy of trust, connection, and relevance, marketing strategies need to reflect a deep understanding of customer value. Unfortunately, the classic, persona-based form of marketing isn’t designed to achieve that outcome. We need a new way to be relevant.\nFortunately, there’s a framework to help marketers do just that: “Jobs to be Done”. It’s designed—and proven—to give tremendous insight into the true value you provide to your customers. Knowing what your customers “hire” your product or service to do means you know how to help them achieve their goals. That’s true relevance!\nCome learn about the Jobs-to-be-Done mindset, see how it worked for others, and walk away with a fresh way to be truly relevant to your customers.",

Designing a user experience without paying attention to unconscious biases is leaving out small changes that, in turn, alienate large demographics of people and shrink your client base. On the other hand, making these small changes could be just the kickstart your product needs to expand and catch on within other demographics.

Join us to learn how Service Analytics, a new analytics app from Salesforce, can quickly expose insights from all your Service Cloud channel data.

    "sessionAbstract": "Over the past decade, companies across every industry have begun shifting towards “as a service” or recurring revenue business models. During this same time, Wall Street has begun to understand and value the benefits that a subscription model can provide. As a result executive leaders and intrapreneurs are finding innovative ways to disrupt their own companies and reshape markets. Some are experimenting on the margin to figure out the formula while others have gone all in to transform and re-invent their entire company. \n \nAs enterprises move towards recurring revenue services, it's not enough to get the customer experience right at the moment of the transaction, there must be a focus on the regular addition of rich, value-driven features to the service to retain subscribers. Ongoing enablement is a key component of the recurring revenue model precisely because subscriptions can be easily abandoned if customers find better value elsewhere.\n \nIn this session we'll discuss recurring revenue market trends, transformation patterns and the pitfalls we've seen companies make as they have attempted to implement these new models. We'll also share our thoughts on the elements for success and try to illuminate a path you can take as you blaze your trail to a new recurring revenue business model.",

    "sessionAbstract": "Do you hate Triggers and APEX? Me too! I am not a developer, yet I develop complex processes using two awesome declarative tools called Process Builder and Flow. I have eliminated a number of triggers and the need for other code by dragging and dropping my way to declarative freedom. Dev resources are hard to come by, but that doesn't stop my user base from asking for more and more complex automation in our org. With process builder and flow, I can make complex decision trees, cross object look-ups and updates. Button flows or those embedded in Lightning objects, give users' awesome shortcuts, savings dozens of clicks. They also allow for free text to explain the purpose of an object and make record creation and updates easy and understandable.\n\nWhen a complex process does require code, I ask my developer to make sure the Class is Invokable (don't worry, they can figure out how to do this pretty quickly). And then I can set variables in the Class, just like I can for a Flow. The Class can then be called directly by Process Builder or from within a flow. So don't hate the code, learn to overcome it, create processes that you can maintain, activate and deactivate readily. Come to this session and learn some of the Best Practices from an early adopter of these two amazing Salesforce features!",
